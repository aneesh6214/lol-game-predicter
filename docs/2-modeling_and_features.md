# Modeling & Feature Engineering (Planned)

## Overview
This phase will transform the raw data from Step 1 into a set of features suitable for machine learning models. It will also involve building, testing, and refining various predictive models.

## Planned Activities
1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Convert champion selections into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, embeddings).
   - Consider team-level aggregate statistics, champion synergy, or role distributions.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Experiment with multiple classification algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting).
   - Use training-validation splits and cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimates.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimize model parameters to improve accuracy and generalization.

4. **Comparison & Benchmarking:**
   - Compare performance of multiple models and select the most promising candidate.

Once modeling and feature engineering are underway, documentation will be updated to reflect choices, outcomes, and reasoning behind each decision.
