# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the winning team in a League of Legends match based solely on the champions selected during the drafting phase. By leveraging historical ranked match data, I will develop a machine learning model to analyze champion compositions and infer which side has the advantage.

## Objectives
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Utilize real-world game data from League of Legends matches (focusing on Gold-tier ranked games) to guide predictive modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build a robust machine learning model capable of predicting match outcomes from champion picks.
- **Scalable Approach:** Ensure that the data pipeline and model training processes are efficient, maintainable, and adaptable for different ranks, patches, and other variations.

## Project Scope
1. **Data Collection & Preparation:**  
   Retrieve match data, including champion picks and outcomes, from the Riot API. Clean and structure this data for downstream modeling.
   
2. **Feature Engineering & Modeling:**  
   Transform raw champion pick data into meaningful features. Train various machine learning models, compare their performance, and select the most promising approach.

3. **Evaluation & Validation:**  
   Assess model performance using robust evaluation metrics. Validate results to ensure generalizability.

4. **Deployment & Integration:**  
   Integrate the final model into a production environment or corporate tooling, enabling other teams or applications to use the predictive capabilities.

5. **Maintenance & Future Work:**  
   Continuously update the model as game patches and champion balances change. Expand the scope to other tiers or game modes as needed.
