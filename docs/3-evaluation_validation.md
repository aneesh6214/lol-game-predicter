# Evaluation & Validation (Planned)

## Overview
This stage will involve assessing the model’s performance and ensuring it meets the project’s accuracy and reliability requirements.

## Planned Activities
- Evaluate model predictions using standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall).
- Perform cross-validation to prevent overfitting and measure out-of-sample performance.
- Confirm that the model generalizes well to matches not seen during training, ideally spanning multiple patches and champion pools.
